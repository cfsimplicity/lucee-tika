The Tika app jar needs to be converted to an OSGi bundle so lucee can load it on the fly and in isolation.

1. make a copy of downloaded app jar called "tika-app-VERSION.bundle.jar"
2. open copy with 7-zip
3. select META-INF/MANIFEST.MF and press F4 to open
4. add the following to the end, replacing [VERSION] with actual version number:

Bundle-Name: Apache Tika App Bundle
Bundle-SymbolicName: apache-tika-app-bundle
Bundle-Description: Apache Tika App jar converted to an OSGi bundle
Bundle-ManifestVersion: 2
Bundle-Version: [VERSION]
Bundle-ClassPath: .,tika-app-[VERSION].bundle.jar

5. Save choosing to update when prompted.

NB: Automating via a CommandBox task runner is too processing intensive due to the size of the jar file
